# Cestopis / Travelbook / Libro de viaje

Right now I'm travelling (or I'm not and I haven't changed this text) and I'm travelling pretty much long time and long way. And I want to create an interactive online "book" about my travel. Basically - lot of unfunny text, some maps, photos, etc. And, here comes this project. 

The main focus of this project are maps - displaying all the way I've made with distinguishing differents types of transport (avion, walking, buses, hitchhiking, rented car, boat). 

## It is divided into two parts:
* private - the "administration interface", divided into frontend and backend, not made to be nice-looking or even easy to use (hovewer, it should be easy to run it, just two npm install, tsc, webpack and node .)
* public - right now, non-existent. Should display 

## How to run it?

* There's no reason to run this right now, as it is pretty much nothing but strange example of unsing leaflet. But, here are steps to run this:
1. Clone the repo
2. Execute `npm install` in both `private/backend` and `private/frontend` directories
3. Execute `webpack` in `private/frontend` directory
4. Execute `tsc` in `private/backend` directory
5. Run it with `node .`
6. Connect with browser to `http://localhost:9080/` (or whatever it shows)
7. Enjoy the nothingness and nonusefullness of this project!
